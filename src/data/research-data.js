      "Lifestyle change is key to managing chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. However, constraints on resources and time within Singapore's healthcare systems often lead to suboptimal support for patients in their efforts to improve lifestyle habits.",
      "To address this, we partner with the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Duke-NUS Medical School to develop EMPOWERâ€”a mobile app-based platform for the efficient and effective management of chronic diseases. By using a dedicated mobile app, patients can log a comprehensive range of activities and receive intelligent nudges based on these logs. They can also review their logs as reports, play games, or share them with healthcare workers. Users benefit from personalized healthcare services, while healthcare professionals can utilise technology to streamline and enhance care delivery.",
      "Preliminary results from an ongoing longitudinal field study revealed that participants who used EMPOWER fared better in diabetes management than those from the control group.",
      "Empower is currently available via invitation for Android and iOS users. Future planned features for Empower include an updated food database, integration with more advanced wearables such as Apple devices and glucometers, facilitation for health coach-patient interactions, and AI-assisted smart nudges based on the latest research in machine learning. Our innovative approach to care, featuring multi-component intervention, has the potential to improve outcomes in the management of chronic diseases.",

    content: [
      "Due to the shift work and irregular working hours that pilots and airline crew may face, working on long-haul flights is associated with multiple health problems. One widely investigated health issue is pilot fatigue. According to Caldwell (2005), approximately 4% to 8% of aviation incidents and accidents can be attributed to fatigued pilots. With the prevalence of long-haul and ultra-haul flights in recent years, it is critical to consider how air crew's levels of fatigue and alertness adapt to the more demanding flight duties. While airline companies have made great efforts to monitor and evaluate air crew fatigue, it still meets severe challenges in monitoring and evaluating air crew fatigue.",
      "To address this, we partner with the SIA-NUS Digital Aviation Corporate Lab (SIA-NUS) to develop Wellness Buddy - a platform to measure and model stages of occupational fatigue. Featuring questionnaires and measurement tools from state-of-the-art research, Wellness Buddy is designed to model the effects of consecutive flight duties when predicting air crew fatigue and well-being. Data from this platform will be used to develop a novel fatigue modelling and prediction model that considers individual heterogeneity and complex interactions that exist among fatigue factors. This model can provide more accurate fatigue predictions hence enhancing air crew safety and well-being while maintaining professional standards of work performance.",

      "Given the rise in patients with cognitive decline in Singapore, enhancing the therapy process for patients in rehabilitation can lead to benefits for the individual both in addressing their cognitive decline and improving their well-being. Working towards this objective, we have developed Virtual Reality (VR)-assisted therapy for patients in rehabilitation. Our solution aims to validate psychosocial intervention for rehabilitation / dementia patients through solutions such as reminiscence therapy, music therapy and occupational therapy. VR-assisted reminiscence therapy involves encouraging patients to revisit memories from the past, for instance through recreating a museum scene for them to identify important people. Music therapy focuses on creative outlets such as listening to calming sounds of nature while occupational theory could involve VR-created scenes of a beach for patients to walk around. Ultimately, these VR-assisted therapeutic solutions aim to enhance emotional well-being, reduce behavioural symptoms, and promote everyday functioning.",

      "Cognitive decline prevention can be achieved through early detection of cognitive impairment. However, the cost of cognitive screening is prohibitively high, and hospitals face constraints on manpower, space, and cost. To address the lack of early detection of cognitive impairment, we are developing a digital solution, the MindPRO Super App, that can provide a quick assessment of brain functions to detect any impairment of cognitive functions even at the slightest range. MindPRO focuses on the testing of the user's frontal lobe capabilities in order to efficiently assess all the functions more commonly associated with head injuries, dementia and chronic diseases and provide quick follow-up if required. Initial results from an ongoing validation study that tests MindPRO against conventional hospital pen-and-paper screening tests have been promising.",

      "Conventional contact sensor-based health measurement systems may cause discomfort and inconvenience to the patient especially with the pandemic situation where non-contact solutions are preferred. Some conventional health measurement systems also do not support long-term monitoring of elderly patients who experience difficulties accessing healthcare due to immobility. Our team has designed an AI-assisted non-contact health measurement systems that monitors vital signs through a series of remote sensors. Wireless vital signal monitoring enables healthcare practitioners to accurately monitor and assess the patient's vital signs remotely, ensuring that quality healthcare can reach all those who need it. With Cognify having achieved high accuracy (88.2% - 94.6%) for tests of vital signs such as respiration rate, blood pressure, and heart rate, our next aim is to reach 95% accuracy through machine learning with more data.",
