                    The healthcare journey for an individual encompasses a broad range of areas from managing wellness in our daily lives to receiving care in homes or dedicated healthcare facilities. While healthcare systems endeavour to provide reliable and effective care for all, they face constraints on resources like time, manpower, and funding. Technology-based solutions offer a way to overcome such limitations through the enhancement of healthcare delivery for the individual. Through these solutions, we strive towards our vision of empowering the individual in their healthcare journey.

                    Our research mission is to develop and employ solutions that incorporate Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and platforms, real-world empirical evidence, and contemporary social science research. We have built IoT technology-based solutions such as EMPOWER, a mobile app-based platform that enhances chronic disease management through greater accessibility and personalisation; iMovinâ€™, a technology-based intervention comprising a wireless activity tracker and a multi-feature mobile app that delivers personalised and persuasive health messages to encourage exercise; and Wellness Buddy, a platform to measure and model workplace fatigue to enhance employee well-being while maintaining high operational capabilities.
